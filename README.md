# Resources and Asset Aggregation Working Group
Under the Developer Relations Foundation (DRF), the Resources and Asset Aggregation working group uses this repository for our work.

- Our mission is to aggregate resources for a wide variety of use cases to support the Developer Relations professional community. This takes the form of a Persona Library, Tools Catalog, and Event Directory. Learn more about our mission from our [charter](./CHARTER.md).
- Our progress on our strategic [goals](./GOALS.md) for the year can be followed through [projects](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
- We welcome contributions and questions via [Discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions) or [Issues](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/issues) within this repository.
- Our mailing list to subscribe for announcements is here: https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/wg-resource-aggregation
