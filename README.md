# Resources Working Group

The **Resources Working Group** is a focused group within the [Developer Relations Foundation](https://dev-rel.org) (DRF) that aims to aggregate resources that support the mission of elevating the professional practice of Developer Relations. This is accomplished by sourcing existing assets already created by others in the community and by innovating in the creation of new projects to fill in gaps and increase accessibility to the professional tactics of the role.

- Learn more about the vision for this working group by reviewing our [charter](./CHARTER.md).
- Progress on our strategic [goals](./GOALS.md) for the year can be followed through our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/projects?query=is%3Aopen) and [Milestones](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/milestones).
- The group is open for anybody to join and we welcome contributions and questions via GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions) or [Issues]() within this repository.
