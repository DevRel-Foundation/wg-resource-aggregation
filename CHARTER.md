- meeting/presentation announcements
- used by managers for any working group announcements
- low volume

*GitHub*
- **GitHub Discussions** used for working group feedback, suggestions, meeting agendas / minutes, and polls
- **GitHub Issues** used to track working group tasks
- **GitHub Projects** used to track multiple tasks into an outcome-driven kanban aligned with working group strategic goals
- **GitHub Pull Requests** provide opportunity for feedback from participants on any working group operating document changes

*Discord*
- use the #resource-aggregation channel for working group specific chat
- agenda and summary of any working group calls
- higher frequency of updates to call attention to activity from other channels
- real-time project coordination (please keep major items on GitHub discussions)
- misc discussions

*Zoom*
- see the next section for more about working group calls

### 3.2 Working Group Calls

Real-time communication will utilize the working group calendar to list events to be held using Zoom for teleconferencing.

*Agenda*
- agenda is set by managers with a call for topics a reasonable amount of time ahead of a call
- the agenda is published publicly to the [working-group-calls](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/working-group-calls) section of discussions

*Minutes*
- the meeting minutes and attendees should be recorded in the [wg-resource-aggregation discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/working-group-calls) by managers within a reasonable amount of time following the call

*Schedule/Cadence*
- once per month on WED or THU at 9:00PM UTC
- to be held mid-week so that it does not fall on APAC weekends with Friday schedule
- once per quarter, assess from participants in community whether we need to have two separate sessions to accomodate different time zones
- announced via the [working group calendar](https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/wg-resource-aggregation/calendar), mailing list and discord channel

The procedure for hosting working group calls is described here:
