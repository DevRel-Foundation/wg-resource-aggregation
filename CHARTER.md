## 1. Working Group Definition

The primary objectives of the resource aggregation working group includes themes such as:
- Aggregate and make accessible existing assets that support DevRel practitioners.
- Create a library of developer personas to guide engagement strategies.
- Curate a directory of DevRel-specific software and tools.
- Maintain an events/CFP directory to support the community’s participation in relevant industry events.
- Develop resources to track product feedback from the community in a structured way.

### 1.1 Process for Aggregating Assets

### 1.2 Library of Developer Personas

A persona represents the type of user that may or may not engage with a product or service. The value of a persona comes from using it to align a business around expectations for current and potential buyers or customers.

The goal for the working group then is to build a persona library and supporting materials to:

- identify key terminology for persona development and types of personas
- define a schema that can be used for a variety of use cases
- provide a versioning scheme to account for persona updates
- manage the library for where personas are discoverable (storage, search, presentation)
- evaluate criteria for accepting and rejecting contributions to the persona library
- collect and share open data-driven segmentation data as it relates to personas
- create educational resources around creating and using personas in developer relations practices

Annually, the working group should survey and identify when and how the community is using the persona library successfully to fine-tune marketing materials, improve user experience, or better understand the buyer's journey. The survey results and insights are to be shared with the community.

### 1.3 Catalog of Software and Tools

Developer Relations professionals must use a diverse set of software and tools to accomplish the mission of the role. The value of having a catalog of software and tools is to support the discoverability of resources that help solve day-to-day operational challenges. The problems which a tool may solve can be varied including customer relationship management, ticketing, content authoring, video editing, communication, software development, etc. 

The goal for the working group then is to build a catalog that can:

- define organizing principles for what constitutes a tool (problem-oriented, categorical)
- manage the catalog for where tools are discoverable (storage, search, presentation)
- provide a fair and balanced representation of resources that may include competing commercial products
- system for dispute resolution where a community member and tool-owner may have diverging perspectives

Annually, the working group should survey the community for feedback to identify changes in tooling used by professionals in their marketing, sales, product, and engineering tasks.

### 1.4 Directory of Events

Community is an important part of many Developer Relations programs. Events allow a community to come together to exchange ideas, whether in-person or virtually. Some events may have a single topic while others may have a diverse set of tracks that cover a variety of subjects. Events may be run by a private commercial company, an individual hobbyist, or an event management company. As part of a go-to-market motion, Developer Relations professionals often seek out events that provide speaking calls for papers (CFP) or other sponsorship activities.

- define a schema for events that define dimensions of interest to practitioners
- manage the catalog for where events are discoverable (storage, search, presentation)
- provide a recommended solution for the inter-exchange of event details with existing aggregators, listings, and calendars
- evaluate criteria for accepting or rejecting contributions to the event catalog
- provide educational resources and outreach to event hosts with an opportunity to ensure accuracy of event details

Annually, the working group should survey the community for feedback on the accuracy and utility of the events catalog, dimensions being defined, and the value it provides for their marketing and community efforts.

## 2. Working Group Composition

This working group is composed of volunteers who have experience and interest in developer communities.

Typical participants include professionals who have roles such as: developer advocate, community manager, developer relations engineer, developer evangelist, developer marketing, product management, product marketing manager, etc. 

Organizations that have developer-facing tools can all benefit from a better understanding of the resources available to them. 

### 2.1 Roles & Responsibilities 

To empower participation, we've identified the responsibilities for various types of roles.

#### Community at Large

Participation in this working group is open to all in the community. Individual one-off contributions are welcome by anybody so long as it follows the submission guidelines.

#### Participants

One does not need to be a full participant in order to contribute to the working group. Being identified as a full participant is however a recognition of consistent contributions including:

- attending and engaging in working group community meetings
- volunteering and taking an active role in accomplishing group tasks identified as issues in the repository or during a community meeting
- submitting ideas and recommendations for inclusion in collected resources

We value regular participation so want to recognize those who do.

#### Managers 

Managers are an integral part to the function of the working group and are recognized in order to drive action forward. They should do everything regular participants are expected to do and further:

Communication:
- set recurring meeting times and dates that allow for synchronous communication with participants that may be spread around the globe
- set meeting agendas
- take meeting notes in order to share outcomes and progress
- ensure that participant questions are recognized and addressed across channels
- communicate with the community at regular intervals through updates to github discussions, discord, and the mailing list

Project Management:
- manage tasks by creating [github issues](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/issues) and triaging them for assignment
- follow-up and facilitate the completion of tasks within a reasonable time frame in order to meet working group objectives

### 2.2 Community Feedback

To ensure that community participants are able to contribute feedback on how the working group itself functions and operates we've enabled [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions). Specifically, the [Feedback](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/feedback) category is an area that managers will utilize to post surveys and polls that invite input.

## 3. Meetings

### 3.1 Cadence

### 3.2 Annual Activities 

Ex: budget/finance, meeting planning, elections, etc…


## 4. Working Group Resources

### 4.1 Project Control Center (PCC)

The Linux Foundation provides access to [PCC](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center) which has a set of resources for project administrators that we will leverage for the working group. 

- **Meeting Management Tool**: PCC allows scheduling and sharing calendars to host private and public meetings on Zoom. This supports a larger number of participants, longer meeting times, and recordings / transcripts.
- **Mailing Lists**: PCC allows hosting distribution lists with Groups.io. This is how we distribute email to the working group mailing list.
