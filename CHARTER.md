# Resource Aggregation Working Group Operating Document

## 1. Working Group Definition

The primary objectives of the resource aggregation working group includes themes such as:
- Aggregate and make accessible existing assets that support DevRel practitioners.
- Create a library of developer personas to guide engagement strategies.
- Curate a directory of DevRel-specific software and tools.
- Maintain an events/CFP directory to support the community’s participation in relevant industry events.
- Develop resources to track product feedback from the community in a structured way.

### 1.1 Process for Aggregating Assets

### 1.2 Library of Developer Personas

A persona represents the type of user that may or may not engage with a product or service. The value of a persona comes from using it to align a business around expectations for current and potential buyers or customers.

The goal for the working group then is to build a persona library and supporting materials to:

- identify key terminology for persona development and types of personas
- define a schema that can be used for a variety of use cases
- provide a versioning scheme to account for persona updates
- manage the library for where personas are discoverable (storage, search, presentation)
- evaluate criteria for accepting and rejecting contributions to the persona library
- collect and share open data-driven segmentation data as it relates to personas
- create educational resources around creating and using personas in developer relations practices

Annually, the working group should survey and identify when and how the community is using the persona library successfully to fine-tune marketing materials, improve user experience, or better understand the buyer's journey. The survey results and insights are to be shared with the community.
