# Events Directory

Community is an important part of many Developer Relations programs. Events allow a community to come together to exchange ideas, whether in-person or virtually. Some events may have a single topic while others may have a diverse set of tracks that cover a variety of subjects. Events may be run by a private commercial company, an individual hobbyist, or an event management company. As part of a go-to-market motion, Developer Relations professionals often seek out events that provide speaking calls for papers (CFP) or other sponsorship activities.

An objective of the working group is to aggregate these types of community events. Existing solutions are available but there is a gap between what they provide and the needs of the broader Developer Relations community. 

## Use Cases

The aim for this events directory is to service the broader needs of developer advocates, developer marketing, community managers, product managers, and more. Events may also include professional development opportunities.

### Events by Location

The geographic region is a common and important dimension for events.
- sponsors may focus segmentation of go-to-market activities
- participants may seek local events to attend

### Events by Topic

The topics and technology themes of an event:
- the programming language such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.
- the technical methodology such as DevOps, Data Science, UX, etc.
- the platform such as Android, iOS, etc.
- the technology or software vendor 

### Events by Speaking Opportunity

Seeking opportunities to speak and share information is common.
- when is the CFP deadline
- stipend availability to support speakers

### Events by Attendee Persona and Demographics

The persona or profiles of attendees may influence participation:
- their job titles
- their company or organization
- size of the event

### Open-ended Opportunities

For recurring events, there is often an open opportunity to participate. The event directory can help facilitate the matching problem of speakers to audiences.
- flexible dates

### Event Costs

There are associated costs with events for attendees and sponsors.
- minimum sponsorship
- free events vs. ticketed events

### Co-located and Event Series

There are some events that are not isolated occurrences.
- series such as with meetups
- annual events
- hackathons attached to a conference

### Hosting Events

DevRel professionals often are planning events and may want to coordinate with other events that are important to their community.
- avoid overlapping dates
