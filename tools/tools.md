# Tools Catalog

Developer Relations professionals must use a diverse set of software and tools to accomplish the mission of the role. The value of having a catalog of software and tools is to support the discoverability of resources that help solve day-to-day operational challenges. The problems which a tool may solve can be varied including customer relationship management, ticketing, content authoring, video editing, communication, software development, etc. Those tools may take the form of open-source projects, software-as-a-service, mobile applications, travel accessories, commercial off-the-shelf software, edcuational materials, etc.

## Scope

An objective of the working group is to aggregate a variety of tools that a majority of devrel professionals would consider valuable for completing the expectations of their role. This should not extend infinitely to catalog every tool that may have marginal utility to all technology roles.

Consider some examples:

- a book on building community
- a framework or process for prioritization
- a backpack that is great for travel
- a python debugger for good sample code
- a specific computer monitor
- an agency or consultant that can help plan a devrel program

Each of these could be considered related to the work tasks of a developer relations professional and should be included. Conversely, it may not be particularly helpful if the tool catalog included thirty different variety of keyboards unless there was a qualifier such as "suitable for travel".

Is there a sniff test we can apply to designate what is or is not a tool? It should solve a problem that is applicable to the developer relations roles and profession.

## Categories

Defining categories for tools would be a natural conclusion for the catalog but introduces ambiguity.

- do some tools appear in more than one category?
- do categories change depending on your role or perspective?
- how do we determine if a tool should be in a category or not?
- would a person using the catalog understand the categories?
- how nested would categories need to be to improve searchability?

As an alternative to categories, the catalog can present solutions to tasks.

## Use Cases

### Tools by Persona

The aim for the tools catalog is to service the broader needs of developer advocates, developer marketing, community managers, event managers, product managers, and more. Despite a variety of job titles, there are certain skills or activities that are common in the job description of a developer relations professional that can help guide identification of tools.

### Tools by Task

Some tasks are common across personas, so tools can be categorized by the solutions they provide.

- how-to provide q&a online
- how-to gather feedback
- how-to build a strategy
- how-to manage a community
- how-to travel light
- how-to work while on the go

Given the problem of finding the right tool for a task, there are some examples of aggregated listings of tools but none that provide a comprehensive list to solve all the needs of the developer relations professional.
